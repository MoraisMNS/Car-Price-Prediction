# Car Price Prediction

Predicting car prices using machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR).

## Overview

This project aims to predict car prices based on various features using different machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for training and evaluation was obtained from Kaggle. The models implemented include Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor.

## Dataset
